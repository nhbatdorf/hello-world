The guide that starts it all!

A little about me...

I went to tech school directly after high school to learn to program.
When I graduated, I couldn't immediately find a job in my field and settled for office work.
Once there, I had the opportunity to quit the job and interview for a coding position but turned it down to focus on the job I had.
That was almost 20 years ago and a lot has changed.

Now, I'm looking to get back into coding and starting a career in the field!
